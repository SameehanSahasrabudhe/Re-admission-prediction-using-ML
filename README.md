HOSPITAL ADMISSION FORECASTING AND HEALTH INSURANCE FRAUD DETECTION
This project focuses on two prediction tasks using the CMS DE-SynPUF dataset. 
(1) Predicting hospital admission for patients relies on their outpatient claim history and demographic details. 
(2) Annual cost regression: Can we estimate total yearly healthcare costs based on patient history and utilization?
